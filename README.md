# Monkey
A lexer and Pratt-parser written without any tools, parser generaters or external dependencies. Loosely following the book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball.

[A primer on Pratt-parsing by the author of Rust Analyzer](https://matklad.github.io/2020/04/13/simple-but-powerful-pratt-parsing.html)

Currently done with the 'parsing' chapter of the book, the actual interpreter is still missing. This was a great exercise so far, and a lot more work than I initially expected.
